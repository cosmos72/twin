		   Twin - a Textmode WINdow environment

	     Author: Massimiliano Ghilardi <max@linuz.sns.it>


1. Concepts

   Twin creates, draws and manages windows inside a text terminal.
   It implements in text mode the same concepts that X11 does in graphics:

   a. draw on some kind of screen (tipically a computer monitor).
   b. allow multiple windows to coexist on the same screen,
      and draw independently on each of them.
   c. talk to external programs (even on other machines) so that
      the programs receive keystrokes, mouse movements, etc.
      and can send back drawing commands.

   There are anyway important differences, beyond the trivial one
   that `twin' works in text mode and X11 servers work in graphics:
   
   a. Each window has an associated menu. Many windows can share
      the same menu, and twin always show the menu associated
      to the currently focused window.
   b. In `twin', window borders are part of each window, and can be
      (partially) customized by the external program that draws it.
      Things that you can't tailor in this way are:
      buttons position and look, scrollbars position and look;
      to customize them you must work a little more: you'll have to
      write your own module.
   c. In `twin', windows are not just plain rectangules where programs
      can draw. They can contain `gadgets' (small icons you can select,
      like the buttons you can find in many GUIs) and they can contain
      lines longer that the window width and/or more lines than
      the window height, letting the user scroll them.
   d. Twin implements virtual screens. Each virtual screen has very big
      sizes in both directions (something like 64K character cells),
      and you can scroll them by holding LEFT or MIDDLE mouse buttons
      and moving the mouse to one of the screen borders. Also, you can
      switch to the next virtual screen by clicking on the arrows
      at the top-right of its menu bar.
   e. Twin has a built-in window manager,
      which needs to do a slightly different work than a typical
      X11 window manager: it does window focus changes, window drags
      and resizes, virtual screen changes, menu activity and dispatches
      keystrokes and mouse events to the focused window.
      With the help of a built-in `scroller' it also implements
      virtual screen scrolling and window contents scrolling
      (when you drag the scrollbar or hit the scrollbar buttons).
   f. Twin has a built-in terminal emulator, so you don't have to start
      any program equivalent to xterm in order to run `normal' tty programs.
      Anyway, an external terminal emulator `twterm' is included among
      the clients distributed with twin, in case you really need it.
      Note anyway that `twterm' _needs_ the built-in terminal emulator code
      to be loaded into twin, and twin is capable to auto-load such code
      if needed.


2. Supported hardware

   Twin runs perfectly on the linux console, inside a twin terminal
   (try it, it's really funny) and on X11: it opens a window
   and draws in it, does _not_ run inside an xterm or similar.

   In theory, it would be possible to have twin run inside an xterm, rxvt
   or similar terminal, but it would have problems
   with mouse (xterm doesn't report dragging, only click/release)
   and keyboard (xterm sends different codes than linux console for some keys)
   so it is easier to have twin directly talk to X11.

   Currently, twin is tested only on Intel platforms running Linux.
   I had yet no chance to test it on other systems.
   
   Twin will not run on non-Linux system consoles until someone
   adds to twin the necessary code to access the mouse under such setups.
   If you configure twin `HW support: Linux console' to `n'
   and `HW support: X11' to `y' there are chances twin will work
   on non-Linux systems too (feedback welcome on this).
   
   Beyond using X11 or another copy of itself for output,
   twin can write to screen in two ways:
   a: writing to Linux special devices /dev/vcsa* which have the same layout
      as VGA textmode framebuffer. This allows for _any_ ASCII char
      to be displayed, from 0 to 255 but works only on linux console.
   b: writing on standard output, just like any `normal' textmode program.
      This doesn't allow printing of certain special characters, but shouldn't
      be a big problem. It is also a little slower than (a) but again,
      no big problem.
   Twin will use (a) if available, else fallback on (b).
   
   2.1. Emulated hardware
   
        The built-in terminal emulator behaves as a linux console.
	
	Implementing it on something different than a linux console
	is a little hard, as it would have to translate keyboard sequences:
	
	For example, when you hit <F5>, a linux console sends ESC [ [ 5
	while xterm and derivatives send ESC [ 1 5 ~.
	Having twin correctly running in an xterm also means that each time
	it receives ESC [ 1 5 ~	it must translate it into ESC [ [ 5.
	But what should it do when it receives ESC [ 1 alone?
	Translate to ESC [ [, sent the data without translations,
	or wait for more data? There's no easy answer.


3. Compiling twin

   First, you might want to edit the file `Rules' to change
   the install directory, tweak compiler flags (enable debugging), etc.
   
   Then type `make', answer to the questions, and watch it compile.
   If everything goes fine, you get what follows:
   - `twin_real', the main program, in the server/ subdirectory;
   - `libTw.so*', the library to connect to twin, in the lib/ subdirectory;
   - the various clients (twcat, twterm, ...) in the clients/ subdirectory.
   
   The first time you run `make' or each time you run `make config', a shell
   scripts is executed to let you configure twin.
   If you have "dialog" installed, you can also use `make menuconfig'
   for a somewhat (?) more friendly interface. 
   
   In both cases, the questions asked are equivalent:

   First question:
   
	Enable modules [Y/n] ?
	
   Answer `y' if you want to be able to use modules (= code which can be
   inserted and removed from a running twin whenever you want).

	Builtin Terminal emulator [Y/m/n] ?
	
   Answer `y' or `m' if you want to compile the terminal emulator
   built-in into twin. This code is necessary also to run `twterm',
   the external terminal emulator,
   so answer `n' only if you _really_ know what you are doing.
   
	Support remote socket connections [Y/m/n] ? 
	
   Answer `y' or `m' if you want to be able to run external programs.
   Answer `n' only if you _really_ know what you are doing.
   
           Sockets: Support gzip compression [Y/n] ?
        
   Answer `y' if you want to enable transparent gzip compression in the
   socket connections. Read paragraph `7. Transparent Compression' for details.
   
   	Use custom malloc/free routines (tested on Linux i386 only) [Y/n] ?
   
   Answer 'y' to use home-made, mmap() based replacements of malloc/free.
   Their main (only) advantage is they are very clever in returning
   unused memory to the system.
   Anyway, they are tested only on Linux i386, and furthermore
   they shoot heavily on the kernel mmap subsystem,
   so on some OSes they may give troubles.
   
	HW support: textmode terminals (Linux console, ...) [Y/m/n] ?

   Answer `y' or 'm' if you are interested in running twin
   on text terminals (ttys). You will be asked further questions
   to choose exactly which ttys you want support for.

	   tty support: Linux console [Y/n] ?
   
   Answer 'y' if you are compiling under Linux and you are interested
   in running twin on the Linux console.
   
	   tty support: Twin terminal
   
   Answer 'y' if you are interested in running twin inside
   a twin terminal emulator (i.e. a shell window inside another twin).
   Answer `n' only if you _really_ know what you are doing.

	HW support: X11 [Y/m/n] ?

   Answer 'y' or 'm' if you want twin to be able to display on X.

   	HW support: Twin, native [Y/n] ?

   Answer `y' or 'm' to allow twin to connect to another twin and open a window
   there as display. Answer `n' only if you _really_ know what you are doing.

   If you answer 'n' to both Linux console and X11 support,
   you won't be able to do much with your shiny just compiled twin!
   
   Now you are ready to compile.
   If this is the first time you run `make', everything is automatic.
   If you just typed `make config' or `make menuconfig', then you now need
   to run `make'.
   
   In case you get errors during compilation and you really can't solve
   the problem by your own, you can e-mail me at <max@linuz.sns.it>
   sending an _EXACT_ copy of what `make' printed and also specifying
   your operating system (uname -a), and I'll try to help you.


4. Installing and Starting twin

   If you want to install twin on your system,
   make sure that the DESTDIR set in `Rules' is correct,
   considering that when you will type `make install'
   the various parts of twin will be placed as follows:
   `twin' and the other programs (twterm, etc.) will go in $DESTDIR/bin,
   modules will go in $DESTDIR/lib/twin/modules,
   libTw.so* will go in $DESTDIR/lib.

   Once twin compiled fine, to actually install it,
   type the following command as root:
   
   make install
      
   WARNING:
   on most systems, after the installation it is necessary to run `ldconfig'
   as root before programs can find libTw.so* shared libraries.

   WARNING:
   if you compiled some code as module, twin will search it
   only in $DESTDIR/lib/twin/modules so it may not find the modules
   until you install them.
   To make debugging easier, if you compile with DESTDIR not set then
   twin will look for modules in the current directory. In this way
   it is not necessary to `make install' in order to use modules.
   
   In any case, NEVER try to mix modules from a certain version
   with a `twin' executable of a different version:
   all kinds of bad things may happen.
   The most common effect is that `twin' dies with a SEGFAULT.


   If you compiled some display driver as module, twin will NOT autoprobe
   for it and you will need to use `twin -hw=<display>' to load and use
   a modularized display driver.
   
   After twin is installed, to start it just type
   
   twin
   
   If you did not install twin yet, you can go to the directory where
   you compiled twin, then run:
   
   cd server/
   ./twin_real

   If you want, you can specify the display to use
   instead of letting twin autoprobe; the syntax is:
   
     twin [-hw=<display>[,options]] [-hw=<display>[,options]] ...
     
   where <display> is one of:
   
        X[@<XDISPLAY>]     or    X11[@<XDISPLAY>]
	twin[@<TWDISPLAY>]
	tty[@<tty device>]
	ggi[@<libggi target>]
	
   for an explanation of the available display methods and their options,
   see paragraph 8) below about `twattach' and `twdisplay': they have
   exactly the same syntax as twin for the argument `-hw=<display>[,options]'


5. The Twin UI (User Interface): how to use

   When twin comes up, you will have a blue screen (or window) with a
   white menu bar on the top saying "Hit PAUSE or Mouse Right Button for Menu"
   
   To activate the menu (this is the default menu) do what the writing says:
   either hit the `PAUSE' key or hold down the right mouse button and move
   the mouse on one of the words of the menu bar. A menu window will appear.
   Choose the line you want, then release the right button if you were holding
   it, or hit the `RETURN' key otherwise.
   If you feel slightly offended by reading something so trivial and obvious,
   well, I feel quite stupid too writing it, but I must start from somewhere ;)
   
   Each word in the menu just appeared is a `menuitem'.
   The "ð" menuitem lets you pop up some utility windows, including a Clock,
   the Option window, the Display window and the About window.
   The "File" menuitem lets you quit twin, suspend or detach it and,
   if the built-in terminal emulator code is loaded, open a terminal window.
   The "Edit" menuitem is just a standard entry but it's not usable here.
   The "Modules" menuitem lets you insert/remove modules from the running twin:
   you can "Run Twin Term" to insert the terminal emulator module,
   you can "Stop Twin Term" to kill all terminal windows and unload the module;
   you can "Run Socket Server" to insert the support code for running external
   programs, you can "Stop Socket Server" to remove that code and kill all
   external programs.
   The "Window" menuitem is common to all menus and lets you do several
   operations on windows (explained immediately below)
   
   Ok, enough boring stuff for now... let's jump to something else.

   Each window has its own menu, so opening a new window will give you
   a new menu while the previous gets inaccessible. When you start without
   windows, you are presented the default menu described above.
   Anyway, all menus share a common part: the "Window" menuitem, which
   lets you do basic operations with all windows
   -- Close, Move, Resize, Center, Zoom, cycle through windows (Next) --
   and also lets you open the Window List.
   You can open the Window List also by middle-cliking on the desktop,
   in any area with no windows at all.
   A side effect of opening the Window List is that its menu
   is the default one, so you can get it back. Anyway you can get back
   the default menu also by left-clicking on the screen background, in an area
   with no windows: this un-focuses all windows and, when no window is focused,
   you _always_ get the default menu.
   
   Clicking or hitting `Return' on a window name of the Window List will
   focus and Center the corresponding window.
   Other not-so-obvious things you can do from the Default menu are:
   <ZOOM> to maximize the current window to full-screen;
   Raise/Lower to move the focused window to top/bottom of windows stack
   while keeping it focused.
   
   You can use the menus even without a mouse.
   Hit the `Pause' key (edit server/hotkey.h and recompile to change it)
   to open the menu, then you can transverse the menu with arrow keys, hit
   `Return' to select an entry in a menuitem or `Escape' to close the menu.
   Choosing Menu -> Window -> Move/Resize allows you to move the focused
   window with arrows and resize it with Insert,Delete,PageUp,PageDown.
   Instead, choosing Menu -> Window -> Scroll allows to scroll the focused
   window with the same keys: arrows for one-line scrolls and
   Insert,Delete,PageUp,PageDown for one-page scrolls.

   Now, the next argument: Focusing and Freezing.
   
   Even if it comes quite natural to most people to press the left mouse button
   on the lower-right corner of windows to resize them, a thing you probably
   don't know is that if _while holding the left button_ you also press
   the middle or right button, the window will `freeze', i.e. it doesn't resize
   anymore when you move the mouse, but will istantly resize when you release
   the middle or right button. Also, while the window is `frozen', the virtual
   screen doesn't scroll. The same `freeze' technique can be used while
   dragging a window (to drag a window, press left button on window title).

   Downside:
   `Freezing' does not work if twin displays on X, you have a two-button mouse
   and you configured the X server with Option "Emulate3Buttons".
   That's a limit of your mouse / X server combination.

   Other maybe not-so-obvious things are:
   the button on top-left of each window, drawn as "[]", is the CLOSE button;
   the button on top-right, drawn as two up-down arrows, is the TOP/BACK button:
     click on it in the top window and it will become the last window;
     click on it in a window behind other windows, at it will become
     the top window;
   the scrollbars are quite intuitive: click on the arrows near the lower-right
   corner to scroll the window contents one line (or row) at time;
   drag the `tab' (the solid white bar) to quickly scroll the window;
   click on the space before or after the `tab' to scroll the window contents
   one page at time.
   Unlike older versions (0.2.6 and earlier), twin now splits the concepts
   of top window and focused window: left-clicking on a window will focus it,
   so that keypresses will go to that window, but you will need to click
   on the window's TOP/BACK button to have it become the top window. Clicking
   on the window's TOP/BACK button again will Lower and UnFocus the window.
   
   Twin also implements cut-n-paste, in the same way as linux console, xterm,
   and other terminals: you select some text by moving the mouse with
   the left button pressed and paste by clicking with the middle button.
   
   
6. External programs

   If you have `twin' correctly installed and running (and eventually you
   loaded the Socket Server module) you can run an external program
   by typing its name, just as you do with X11 clients.
   If twin is not installed yet, you will need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the
   directory where libTw.so.1 is: something like
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<twin-top-dir>/lib
   should work.
   Also, if you don't start external programs from within a twin terminal
   window, you will need to set the display. Type
	echo $TWDISPLAY
   inside a twin terminal, then
	export TWDISPLAY=:<the-value-you-got>
   before running your external programs. To run external programs from
   another machine, using TCP sockets, do something like
	export TWDISPLAY=<host-name>:<the-value-you-got>
   In the last case, you will also need to authorize your clients to talk
   to twin. The authorization method currently used is similar to Xauthority:
   the file .TwinAuth in your home directory holds some magic data that
   clients use to answer the challenge received from twin. If that data
   is wrong or the file doesn't exist, clients can connect to twin only
   using the unix socket (TWDISPLAY=:<something>) so they must run
   on the same machine as twin; remote programs won't be able to connect.

   The external programs (clients) distributed with twin are:
   
	twattach  - utility to attach/detach twin from displays
	twdisplay - advanced utility to attach/detach twin from displays
	twcat     - twin-aware version of `cat'
	twedit    - a wannabe twin editor. For now, it's just a test.
	twevent   - display twin events, like xev (X11) and mev (console/gpm)
	twmapscrn - twin equivalent of Linux console tool `mapscrn'
		    NOTE: when started from Linux console, twin will already
		    load the current consolemap translation, so using twmapscrn
		    is often not necessary.
	twsetroot - customize twin background (see clients/README.twsetroot)
	twsysmon  - a system resources monitor
	twterm    - create remote twin terminal windows
	            known options:
		      -e <cmd> [<args> ...]
			: run "<cmd> [<args> ...]" instead of user $SHELL
		      -t <title>
		        : set window name to <title>
			(you will need to enclose <title> in quotes
			if it contains spaces or other special chars)
			
7. Transparent Compression

   Starting from version 0.2.2 twin (and obviously libTw) transparently
   support gzip compressed sockets by using the library `zlib'.
   If the connection between twin and the remote programs you want to run
   is slow, you may benefit from compression.
   
   To allow compression, you must make sure you have zlib installed
   on your system, then answer `y' to the configure question
   
      Sockets: Support gzip compression [Y/n] ?
  
   finally compile twin and libTw.

   To actually use compression, append ",gz"
   to your $TWDISPLAY like in these examples:

      export TWDISPLAY=:0,gz
      export TWDISPLAY=linuz.sns.it:5,gz
      
   
8. Attach/Detach

   Twin can run without a display at all, can attach or detach from a display
   on the fly, and can run on multiple displays simultaneously.
   
   There are various ways to temporarily close a display used by twin:
   
   1) select `Suspend' from the `File' entry of the default menu.
      This is equivalent to the normal Unix job control associated to CTRL-Z:
      twin shuts down its displays and returns to the shell it was started from.
      To resume twin, just type `fg' (or send a SIGCONT to it).
      This may not work if you used 2) below, because that detaches twin
      from the job control mechanism used by shells.
      
   2) select `Detach' from the `File' entry of the default menu.
      WARNING: Be sure the Socket Server can be started before doing this!
               Otherwise you will not be able to reattach twin to any display
	       at all!
      In this case, twin shuts down its displays and detaches
      (by forking in the background) from the shell it was started from,
      but keeps running as a daemon (with no display).
   
   3) run `twdetach' (more explanations below for this, but in this case
      it is equivalent to selecting `Detach' from the default menu).
   
   4) select `Display' from the `ð' entry of the default menu,
      watch the `Display' window pop up, choose a display from the list
      and click on `Remove'.
      
   There are two ways to have twin attach to a display
   (or to ONE MORE display, as twin can use multiple simultaneous displays):
   `twattach' and `twdisplay'.

   Let's start with `twattach':
   
      Basically, you run twattach specifying which display you want *twin*
      to attach to.
      Twin then tries to start that display by its own,
      while twattach only work is to report all messages generated by twin
      during the attach (if you run twattach with the option `-s' (silent),
      then twattach has nothing to do at all).
   
   Instead `twdisplay' works differently:
   
      You run twdisplay specifying which display you want *twdisplay* to use.
      
      Twdisplay tries to start that display, reporting any generated message.
      If the display succeeds in starting up, twdisplay connects to twin,
      registers itself as a special display, and then works as an intermediate
      layer between the display it started and twin:
      twdisplay sends to twin the events generated by the display,
      and when it receives draw requests from twin, it calls the appropriate
      functions of the display to keep it up-to-date.
      
   The two different programs have different advantages and disadvantages:
               
	       
   twattach:   advantages:  fast, efficient, extremely lightweight.
            disadvantages:  completely relies on twin to be able to use
	                    the display. For example, twin running on a host
			    cannot connect to `gpm' running on another,
			    and attaching twin to itself causes a deadlock.
   
   twdisplay:  advantages:  starts up the display by its own.
                            This means that if you have twin running on a host,
			    you can use twdisplay to attach twin to the console
			    of another host, WITH mouse support (gpm).
			    Also protects twdisplay from bugs, quirks and
			    limitations in display drivers and libraries
			    needed by them: libgpm can connect only ONCE
			    to A SINGLE gpm, libX11 tends to call exit() when
			    its X window gets deleted, etc.
			    Using `twdisplay' to attach twin to itself works!
            disadvantages:  eats more CPU and memory.
	    
	    
    Examples:
      
      $ twattach -hw=X
      tell the default twin (corresponding to $TWDISPLAY)
      to attach to the default X server (corresponding to $DISPLAY)

      $ twdetach -hw=X
      tell the default twin
      to detach ONE display attached to the default X server

      $ twdetach -twin@:5
      tell the twin corresponding to :5 to detach from ALL its displays
      and keep running in the background (same as using `Detach' from menu)

      $ twattach -twin@<some twin display> -hw=X@<some X display>
      tell twin correspinding to <some twin display>
      (for example :5, or myhost.somewhere.net:2)
      to attach to the X server corresponding to <some X display>
      The programs `twattach', `twin', and the X server do not need
      to run on the same host as long as they have the permissions
      to talk each other (see below for an explanation about how
      the file .TwinAuth is used for authorization control)
      
      $ twattach -twin@:5 -hw=tty
      tell twin :5 to attach to the same tty device you are running
      `twattach' on. For this to work, both `twattach' and `twin' must
      be running on the same host.

      $ twdisplay -twin@myhost.somewhere.net:1 -hw=tty
      attach twin at myhost.somewhere.net:1 to the tty device you are running
      `twdisplay' on. Since it is actually twdisplay that attaches to the tty,
      while twin just receives a connection from twdisplay and forwards
      drawing commands on that connection, `twdisplay' and `twin' do not need
      to be running on the same host.

      $ twattach -twin@myhost.somewhere.net:1 -hw=tty@-
      tell twin at myhost.somewhere.net:1 to attach to its own controlling tty.
      This does not work if that twin has already detached from its tty,
      but you will be told so in case it happens.

      $ twdetach -twin@myhost.somewhere.net:1 -hw=tty@-
      tell twin at myhost.somewhere.net:1 to detach from its own controlling
      tty (supposing it was used as a display)

      $ twattach -twin@:5 -hw=tty@<some tty device>,TERM=<terminal type>
      tell twin to attach to <some tty device>.
      In this case you must make sure no program is reading/writing
      on <some tty device> (for example you might run `sleep 365d' on it)
      or things will go BADLY wrong.

      WARNING:
        twin has no way to detect if the tty you specified is really
	a supported terminal (a linux console or a twin terminal).
        If you attach twin to an unsupportd terminal,
	things might go BADLY wrong.

      $ twdisplay -twin@myhost.somewhere.net:1 -hw=twin@yourhost:3,gz
      attach twin running on myhost.somewhere.net:1
      to another twin running on yourhost:3 and display on it.
      The final ",gz" means that the connection between `twdisplay'
      and the second `twin' will be compressed.
      
      $ twattach -twin@<some twin display> -hw=ggi
      tell twin to fire up libggi and display on it.
      
      

    The most general syntax of twattach is:
      twattach [-a|-d] [-v|-s] [-twin@<TWDISPLAY>] -hw=<display>[,options]

    The most general syntax of twdisplay is:
      twdisplay [-v|-s] [-twin@<TWDISPLAY>] -hw=<display>[,options]

    switches have the following meaning:
      -a	: send attach command (default)
      -d	: send detach command (same as running `twdetach [args ...]')
      -v	: be verbose and display all messages generated by twin
	          while trying to attach (default)
      -s	: be silent and display no message

    if you do not specify `-twin@<TWDISPLAY>', the default $TWDISPLAY will
    be used.
      
    known displays are:
      
      -hw=X[@<XDISPLAY>]     or    -hw=X11[@<XDISPLAY>]
      -hw=twin[@<TWDISPLAY>]
      -hw=tty[@<tty device>]
      -hw=ggi[@<libggi target>]
	
    and known display options are:
      
      all displays : ",noinput" to start the display as view-only;
                     keyboard and mouse activity on that display
		     will be ignored.
		  
      -hw=X  or
      -hw=X11	: ",font=<fontname>" to choose your favourite X11 font
		  (default: vga)
		: ",drag" to allow using XCopyArea as redrawing speedup.
		  This is off by default as on many X servers XCopyArea
		  actually eats more CPU time than a normal redraw.
		  Your mileage may vary.
      
      -hw=twin	: ",gz" to enable gzip compression on the connecting socket
      
      -hw=tty	: ",stdout" to draw on stdout even if /dev/vcsa* is available
		: ",TERM=<terminal>" to specify the terminal type

      -hw=ggi	: no options, use the zillion of libggi environment variables
		  to control libggi behaviour.



    A common situation is the following:
      
    You have a detached twin, whose TWDISPLAY is :2,
    running on a host (say plato.alter.net),
    you are sitting at the console of another host (say globe.alter.net)
    and you want to attach twin on the console of globe.alter.net.
    How?

    Attaching twin to the X server of globe.alter.net is easy, just run
    this command on globe
    $ twattach -twin@plato.alter.net:2 -hw=X@globe.alter.net:0
    
    or alternatively,
    $ twdisplay -twin@plato.alter.net:2 -hw=X@globe.alter.net:0

    (this requires you have the same .TwinAuth on both hosts
    and that the X server on globe accepts the connection attempt,
    either due to `xhost +plato.alter.net' or by having a suitable
    .Xauthority on both hosts)
      
    But attaching twin (running on plato) to the console of globe is another
    matter, since that twin has no way to reach the tty devices on globe.
    The easiest way is to use `twdisplay', running this command on globe
    console:
    
    $ twdisplay -twin@plato.alter.net:2 -hw=tty

    There are ways to solve the problem without `twdisplay', but they
    are both more complex and less functional, as they either require
    using telnet or ssh from globe to plato (and thus losing the mouse)
    or starting a SECOND twin, this time on globe console, and attaching
    the first twin on it.
    

9.  Installing vga.pcf.gz

    If you want to install the supplied vga.pcf.gz file, for use under X, you
    should do something like this (details will be system dependant):

    copy fonts/vga.pcf.gz from the distribution to a misc fonts directory,
    I used /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc on my system.
    Run `mkfontdir' as root on the directory used.
    Run `xset fp rehash'.
    Use the command 'xlsfonts | grep vga' to see if the font has been
    registered correctly.

    This should fix some problems with twin displaying strange fonts under X,
    since if twin cannot find the `vga' font, it will fallback on `fixed',
    which has different encoding and thus completely different pseudo-graphical
    characters, and makes twin look really ugly.


10. Greetings

    I hope you will like using twin as I liked writing it.
    Have fun...
