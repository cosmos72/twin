Twin - a Textmode WINdow environment, by Massimiliano Ghilardi
--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6.3

Twin is a windowing environment with mouse support, window manager,
terminal emulator and networked clients, all inside a text display.

It supports a variety of displays:
* plain text terminals (any termcap/ncurses compatible terminal,
  Linux console, twin's own terminal emulator);
* X11, where it can be used as a multi-window xterm;
* itself (you can display a twin on another twin);
* twdisplay, a general network-transparent display client, used
  to attach/detach more displays on-the-fly.

Currently, twin is tested on Linux (i386, x86_64, ARM, ARM64, PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc),
on Mac OS X (x86_64) and on FreeBSD (i386, x86_64).
I had yet no chance to seriously test it on other systems.

Documentation


Twin comes with the following documentation:

README		This file.
README.git	Hints to build twin from GIT repository (for developers).
README.porting  Tips and warnings to compile twin on unsupported OSes.
COPYING		License: twin server and clients are GPL'ed software.
COPYING.LIB	Library license: libTutf, libTw, libTT are LGPL'ed.
Changelog.txt	List of all changes between the various versions of twin.
BUGS		Known bugs.
INSTALL		Quick compile/install guide.
system.twinrc	A detailed example of ~/.twinrc look-n-feel configuration file.


The docs/ subdirectory contains additional documentation:

Configure	Description of twin configuration script with the meaning
		of every single option.
Tutorial	A quite complete tour of twin features: the user interface,
		how to use twin clients, compression, attaching/detaching
		displays, fonts. It also contains installation instructions
		and some caveats for system administrators.
libTw.txt	a reference file for programmers who want to write
		twin clients (INCOMPLETE).
libTw++.txt	a reference file for programmers who want to write
		twin C++ clients (INCOMPLETE).

Getting twin


Since you are reading this README, you probably already have it,
anyway twin can be downloaded from

https://github.com/cosmos72/twin


--------------------------------------------------------------
Building and installing twin

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
  ./configure
  make
  
then run as root
  make install
  
on Linux, also remember to run as root:
  ldconfig

on FreeBSD instead, remember to run as root:
  ldconfig -R

To compile twin you need the following programs installed
on your system:
	
  * a Bourne-shell or compatible (for example bash, dash, ash...)
  
  * make (most variants are supported: GNU make, BSD make...)

  * an ANSI C compiler (for example gcc or clang)


For detailed instructions about compiling and installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
sections 3 and 4, distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.

In summary, it is STRONGLY recommended to install at least the following packages before compiling twin
(the exact names depend on the operating system or Linux distribution):

  * x11-dev      - may be named x11-devel, libx11-dev ...
  * xpm-dev      - may be named xpm-devel, libxpm-dev ...
  * ncurses-dev  - may be named ncurses-devel, libncurses-dev ...
  * zlib-dev     - may be named zlib1g-dev, zlib-devel, libzlib-dev ...

On Linux, it is STRONGLY recommended to also install the following package before compiling twin:

  * gpm-dev      - may be named gpm-devel, libgpm-dev ...

For a discussion about MANUALLY configuring twin (almost never necessary),
see the help file `Configure', again in the docs/ subdirectory.
-- WARNING: if you manually enable options that were disabled by `./configure',
build will almost certainly fail! --
