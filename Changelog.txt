From 0.3.9 to 0.3.10: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 31 Jul 2001)
	* Added `twdm' client. You can now use `twdm' as login manager instead
	  of the obsolete `getty', `login' or the bloated `xdm', `kdm', ... !
	* Added `autoconf' support. Twin now uses GNU `./configure' script
	  to detect OS features.
	* Added command-line driven configuration. Beyond running
	  `make config' or `make menuconfig' interactively, twin can now be
	  configured with `./configure --enable-<feature>=[yes|no|mod] ...'
	  or with `scripts/Configure --enable-<feature>=[yes|no|mod] ...'
	* Added `-secure' option to twin, forbids starting external programs
	  (used by `twdm' to stop users from opening root shells).
	* Merged include/sockprotolist.h and libs/libTw/listmacros.h
	  into include/socklistm4.h
	* Started writing libTT, `The Text Toolkit' library.
	* Fixed some more build problems on FreeBSD and SunOS.
	  Disabled threads on FreeBSD since cause clients to segfault.
	  Any *BSD expert willing to help?
	* Fixed server event reporting bug after clicking on a gadget.
	* Fixed AVL trees using uninitialized fields.
	* Added support for nested menus (can be created, but are not
	  correctly rendered yet).
	* Fixed setting tty speed, was forced to 0 baud.
	
From 0.3.8 to 0.3.9: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 25 Jun 2001)
	* Added Unicode support.
	* New libTutf library to convert between Unicode and other charsets.
	* Added `charset=' option to -hw=X11 and -hw=tty.
	* Bumped libTw major version to 3 due to the following changes:
	  * Added prototype checking to Tw_FindFunction.
	  * Changed events from Window-centric to Widget-centric, to
	    accommodate for corresponding changes in the server.
	  * Changed prototype of some crucial functions: Tw_CreateMenu,
	    Tw_CreateWidget, Tw_CreateGadget, Tw_CreateWindow, Tw_CreateGroup.
	* Updated all clients to libTw.so.3 API.
	* Fixed libTw segfaults upon receiving huge replies from server.
	* Fixed a lot of libTw pointer alignment problems on non-i386
	  architectures. Some unaligned pointer accesses still probably exist.
	* Added libTw sanity checks to avoid compiling a client against a libTw
	  with certain data sizes and running it with another libTw with
	  incompatible data sizes (i.e. if you changed Unicode support).
	* Added Tw_*Stat() functions to retrieve information on libTw objects.
	  Also added `twlsobj' client to demonstrate Tw_*Stat() usage.
	* Added mouse motion reporting (with no buttons pressed).
	  To enable it from a libTw client, set the TW_WINDOW_WANT_MOUSE_MOTION
	  flag in twidget->Attrib.
	  To enable it from within a terminal, send "\033[?999h",
	  to disable send "\033[?999l" (or "\033[?9h" to return to `normal'
	  mouse reporting).
	* Added cut-n-paste on "Execute" window.
	* Added keyboard shortcuts to navigate through gadgets on
	  WINDOW_AUTO_KEYS windows: use Arrows, TAB, Return and Escape.
	* Added dummy support for xterm's change icon title escape sequence.
	* Started writing twdialog (UNFINISHED).
	* Fixed shadow drawing errors in mapping/unmapping rolled up windows.
	* Fixed scrolling and resizing of top window not to corrupt menu bar.
	* Fixed window mouse selection and cursor visibility when menubar
	  is not on top of display.
	* Fixed two stupid server bugs introduced in 0.3.8 that made
	  twsysmon and twcat non working.
	* Fixed off-by-two resize errors with -hw=twin and in twterm client,
	  caused by 0.3.8 change to use given size as window INTERIOR size,
	  not considering the border.
	* Fixed error recovery on parsing errors in ~/.twinrc file.
	* Started porting to SunOS (mostly contributed by Brian Witt),
	  and substituted the bash/sed/grep script `MkDep' with a pure
	  C implementation (grabbed and adapted from Linux kernel sources).
	* libTw optimization: AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) trees used
	  to speed up listener search (grabbed from Linux kernel sources too).
	* Rewrote server-side implementation of libTw using `m4' preprocessor.
	  Design is now more complex, but resulting code is less than half of
	  the original size if CONF_SOCKET_ALIEN is enabled.
	* Cleaned up Tw/Tw++.h wrapper: (tlistener) type is now opaque,
	  so that C++ clients do not depend on libTw internals.
	* Decided and implemented sub-windows focus policy (sub-windows are
	  windows contained or `mapped' inside other windows).
	* Added support for placing cursor in a sub-window.
	* Documented 0.3.8 last minute fix in Changelog (read below).
	
From 0.3.7 to 0.3.8: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 08 Mar 2001)
	* Last minute fix: added InitAlloc() call to twdisplay.
	* Added printing of window size on menu during Interactive Resize.
	* Fixed ~/.twinrc "Resize" command to work correctly when given
	  absolute numbers (i.e. "Resize 92 31" results in a 92x31 window).
	* Fixed redrawing during press/unpress of gadgets on non-top windows.
	* Fixed TwCreateWindow() to use given size as window INTERIOR size,
	  not considering the border. Old clients on new server will create
	  slightly larger windows, new clients on old server will create
	  slightly smaller windows... really not lethal.
	* Fixed TwResizeWindow() for the same problem, and allowed
	  TwResizeWindow() also on non-user-resizeable windows.
	* Fixed libTw++.h using an uninitialized variable that randomly
	  resulted in non-working listeners.
	* Fixed terminal emulator to work also as module. Noone noticed this!?
	* Added socket protocol translation to allow connections from clients
	  with different data sizes and different endianity.
	  Completely backward compatible, as socket protocol was designed
	  for this, but I did not actually implement translation until now.
	  Set CONF_SOCKET_ALIEN in configuration as `y' or `m' to enable it.
	  Known problems still remain in libTw and socket.so on architectures
	  not allowing unaligned pointers.
	* Added support for TW_WINFL_USEEXPOSE windows and corresponding
	  expose messages (they have type == TW_MSG_WINDOW_CHANGE
	  and code == TW_MSG_WINDOW_EXPOSE).
	* `twsendmsg Builtin quit' now forces twin to exit. Also changed
	  the twsendmsg default message code from `quit' to `open' : more
	  useful and less risky.
	* Renamed `DESTDIR' as `libdir' and used `DESTDIR' only for
	  installation.
	* Applied twin-devfs, twin-ncurses and twin-optflags patches from
	  PLD team (www.pld.org.pl).
	  
From 0.3.6 to 0.3.7: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 19 Feb 2001)
	* Changed the terminal emulator to close window on shell logout
	  even if there are background processes running (they keep running
	  without a tty).
	* Also changed the terminal emulator code to set window title
	  from the program name.
	* Changed hilight/selection on windows not to react to simple clicks:
	  now you need to hold mouse button, drag, then release.
	* Fixed compile problems on non-(Linux,FreeBSD) systems: changed GNU
	  `grep -E' into plain `grep' and fixed MakeRules to autodetect if
	  "echo" or "echo -e" must to be used to interpret octal sequences.
	* Fixed an obscure bug with selection paste on a partially obscured
	  window.
	* Fixed drawing error in Roll Toggle of Maximized windows when
	  menu was not hidden.
	* Fixed non-working Interactive Drag,Resize if activated with mouse
	  from the menu (broken in 0.3.6).
	* Fixed keyboard traversing of menus having ONLY the common part.
	* Fixed non-working virtual screen scrolling while doing Interactive
	  Drag,Resize activated with mouse.
	* Fixed virtual screen problems: stale selected menubar was drawn when
	  moving down all screens, and clicking on it resulted in a sefgault.
	  Also, activity in a window on a non-top screen was drawn on display
	  even if the window was obscured by another screen.
	* Further X11 keyboard support cleanups: made arrows and other
	  special keys work also with NumLock/CapsLock active.
	* Simplified menu windows handling, renamed all object types to
	  use pointers (*) implicitly (no user visible changes).
	* Optimized display redrawing during heavy activity.
	* Finished borderless windows support (use Flag TW_WINFL_BORDERLESS).
	* Added GADGET_TOGGLE flag to use gadgets as checkable buttons,
	  and new `group' object to use gadgets as radio buttons.
	* Added new ~/.twinrc command to load/unload modules:
	  Module <name> [On|Off]
	* Added configuration option to log twin messages in "Messages" window.
	* Updated twin to correctly configure display flags like
	  bell duration/pitch, application keypad, alternate cursor keys.
	* Updated twevent to print human-readable key names.
	* Finished client-to-client messages, upgraded twevent and twterm to
  	  support them. New tiny client `twsendmsg' to send client-to-client
	  messages: useful to open a new shell window (or any other program
	  running in a tty) from command line: try something like
	  twsendmsg "Builtin" open
	  or
	  twsendmsg "Remote Twin Term" open
	* Fixed non-reentrant libTw problems.
	* Added configuration option to make libTw thread-safe (requires
	  POSIX pthread.h). Warning: calling libTw functions asynchronously
	  (i.e. from signal handler) will very often cause a deadlock!
	  Also fixed a semantic issue about blocking in Tw_Flush()
	  and Tw_ReadMsg().
	* Added stupid demo client `twthreadtest' to try libTw with threads.
	* Added more detailed libTw error reporting (Tw_StrErrorDetail()).
	* Added some more libTw functions.
	* Added C++ libTw wrapper (libTw++.h). Also wrote the first "serious"
	  client: `twkalc', derived from `kcalc' of the KDE suite.
	  Anyway `twkalc' is distributed separately, in the package `twutils'.
	* Rationalized and removed some redundant libTw functions.
	  Source, binary and socket protocol compatibility preserved, with two
	  exceptions: using libTw from 0.3.7 with older servers may result in
	  "libTw error: function not supported by server: Tw_MapWidget"
	  or similar errors;
	  Also, you must now explicitly #include <libTwerrno.h> to access
	  TwErrno, TwStrError() and related stuff like TW_E* error codes.
	* Added libTw prototypes to use with Linux ltrace(1) in
	  docs/ltrace.conf
	
From 0.3.5 to 0.3.6: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 14 Jan 2001)
	* Added limited ShiftFlags reporting on keyboard events.
	* Added ShiftFlags support to Key bindings in ~/.twinrc and
	  a commented out example for using Alt-Tab to cycle through windows.
	* Added Menu -> File -> Execute to run arbitrary programs
	  without having to open a terminal.
	* Started adding borderless windows (still incomplete).
	* Added option ",slow" to all display drivers.
	* Added support for xterm's change window title escape sequence.
	* Added support for nested windows. For example, the "Remove" and
	  "This" buttons in Menu -> ð -> Display window now are actually
	  inside a sub-window. This was a much bigger work than what
	  it may seem.
	* Updated twterm and twin server to correctly allow choosing which
	  xterm-style protocol to send to applications.
	* Changed signedness of all libTw function parameters used for
	  coordinates and sizes... for consistency they are now signed
	  integers (`dat' or `ldat'). No need to recompile the clients.
	  This allows to place windows (and sub-windows) at negative coords
	  with respect to their parent.
	* Changed some libTw functions not yet used by any client to take
	  advantage of the new general `widget' type.
	* Fixed missing setting TERM=linux in twterm.
	* Fixed RC Virtual Machine to use the window you clicked upon instead
	  of the currently focused window.
	* Fixed SEGFAULT on Menu -> Window -> Send HotKey and RC function
	  `SyntheticKey' used by it.
	* Fixed Menu -> Window -> Next and RC function `Window 1' used by it.
	* Fixed SneakSetupMouse(): there were some glitches
	  if you did Interactive [Menu,Scroll,...] with keyboard
	  and then you pressed mouse (yeah, evil).
	* Fixed cursor positioning during Interactive Drag or Scroll of
	  FullScreen first window on -hw=tty display if /dev/vcsa* output
	  was used.
	* Some more tweaking in -hw=tty display driver.
	* Fixed an old bug on backward window text selection.
	* Fixed another bug concerning selection on WINFL_USEROWS windows.
	* Fixed a compile bug in methods.c when modules are disabled.
	* Fixed a compile problem with X11 display driver on some platforms.
	* Fixed display corruption when running "mutt" inside "screen"
	  inside "twterm"... I wrote absolute/relative coords the wrong way.
	  Thanks to the helpful guy that reported this bug but never sent
	  strace logs of it *grin*.
	* Fixed redrawing of rolled-up out-of-screen windows.
	* Changed selection color and tty display driver mouse pointer color.
	* Fixed server and socket protocol versioning.
	* New `make Torture' target: it compiles every possible source file
	  under every possible configuration. Use to help me find bugs!
	  You can torture a specific set of source files with
	  `make torture.<file1>.c torture.<file2>c ...'
	  Example: `cd server; make torture.wm.c torture.methods.c'
	* Fixed another pair of compile bugs found with `make Torture'.
	
From 0.3.4 to 0.3.5: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 20 Dec 2000)
	* Compatibility break: fixed heavily sick mouse event protocol
	  (it swapped middle/right buttons in Drag and Release, both
	  on server and client side). This means that mouse-aware clients
	  compiled against pre-0.3.5 libTw will not work properly with
	  twin 0.3.5 and vice-versa. Sorry.
	* Removed suid-root or sgid-tty privileges to twin.
	  You will need to manually add such privileges,
	  as you do it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
	* Made the builtin window manager configurable and added RC parser
	  for ~/.twinrc configuration file. In addition to creating the
	  bison/yacc and lex files for RC parser and the RC Virtual Machine
	  (it runs mouse/keyboard binds and menu functions),
	  I had to completely rewrite the window manager :-(
	* Internal changes to accommodate for on-the-fly reload of ~/.twinrc
	  The common part of the menu is not anymore a private copy:
	  all menus access the same shared entry, which can change without
	  having to adjust each menu (no user-visible effects).
	* Renamed twattach/twdisplay `-s' (silent) option to `-q' (quiet).
	  Also changed silent/quiet option implementation to avoid
	  race conditions. Mixing twin, twattach or twdisplay from
	  version 0.3.5 with older ones will not work if you specify
	  `-q' (or `-s' for older versions).
	* Added exclusive displays:
	  started using option `-x' from twin, twattach or twdisplay.
	  Option `-s' now means "shared" and is opposite of `-x' "exclusive".
	* New mini-client `twfindtwin' to find the TWDISPLAY of a running twin
	  and mini-script `twstart' to attach to a running twin or start it.
	* Added sanity version checking on all modules.
	  Twin now refuses to load a module of different version.
	* Cleaned up X11 driver shutdown in case of errors.
	  Now closing an X window used by twin only detaches
	  that display, without killing twin.
	* Removed panic shutdown when getting SIGHUP. Now SIGHUP just
	  closes the display attached to the controlling tty, if any.
	  In practice: closing the tty where twin is running in
	  no longer causes twin to quit, but just to detach from the tty.
	  To quit, ALWAYS use Menu -> File -> Quit.
	* Fixed a compile bug in hw_tty.c when termcap/ncurses driver
	  was not enabled.
	* Fixed drawing errors when scrolling text in a rolled up window.
	* Added stricter compile checks using `const' attribute.
	* Updated the README and started writing other documentation
	  in docs/ subdirectory (still incomplete).
	* Renamed Menu -> ð -> Borders window as Menu -> ð -> Buttons.
	
From 0.3.3 to 0.3.4: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 11 Sep 2000)
        * FreeBSD support added by Andreas Schweitzer. Thanks!
	* Fixed SEGFAULT when doing cut-n-paste on -hw=tty,stdout.
	* twdisplay did not react correctly to resize denials. Fixed.
	* Option `-nohw' added to twin: starts in the background without
	  display.
	* Options `-h', `-help', `-V' and `-version' added to twin and twterm.
	* Termcap/ncurses driver added to -hw=tty. Now twin can run on almost
	  any text terminal.
	* Options ",termcap", ",colorbug" and  ",xterm" added to -hw=tty.
	* RollUp button "><" added on all windows. Can reduce the window
	  to its titlebar and restore it to normal size.
	* Support for "floating" shadows added (i.e. so displaced to be
	  separated from the window).
	* Menu -> ð -> Borders window added to tweak window borders look.
	  Currently allows to move buttons.
	
From 0.3.2 to 0.3.3: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 12 Jul 2000)
	* Ported to AIX 3.2. I only had to fix minor problems
	  like #includes and a few functions not available on it.
	  Twin still does not compile out-of-the-box on AIX 3.2 and
	  you need to work a little manually, see README.porting.
	* Added twin <-> libTw protocol handshaking.
	  Tweaked internal libTw protocol to allow passing NULL
	  instead of arrays where it makes sense;
	  WARNING: don't mix twin or libTw from 0.3.3 and up
	  with older twin or libTw... it will not work.
	* Cleaned up and modularized the window manager.
	  Now you can write your own twin window manager!
	* Fixed SEGFAULT on video activity while running detached.
	* Fixed two socket-related bugs that could send libTw
	  initialization data to the wrong client, freezing both who gets
	  the unexpected data and who was waiting for it.
	  This happened more often if twdisplay was in use.
	* Optimized custom malloc/free with memory blocks > PAGE_SIZE.
	* Added mouse support and `This' button to Display Window.
	* X11 keyboard support cleanups.
	
From 0.3.1 to 0.3.2: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 08 Jun 2000)
	* Fixed internal FdWQueued bookkeeping.
	* Fixed mouse redrawing problems with `-hw=tty'.
	* Fixed libTw to let twattach and twdisplay work
	  also on compressed connections.
	* Fixed a few SEGFAULTs on exit.
	* Fixed a buffer overrun in twterm
	  which sometimes made it completely non-working.
	* Fixed 1x1 display detection after Menu -> ð -> Detach
	* New option `,noinput' common to all display HW : starts the display
	  as view-only, ignoring all mouse/keyboard input coming from it.
        * Added `make menuconfig': it uses "dialog" as user interface.
	  Of course, let me know if your version of dialog gives problems
	  on `make menuconfig'.
	* Fixed palette support on Linux console.
	* Completely rewritten cut-and-paste code to make it non-blocking
	  on the server. Updated all clients, display drivers and twdisplay
	  for the new Selection API: now twdisplay supports Selection too.
	  Selection support on hw_tty and hw_ggi is still missing
	  since underlying HW does not have an usable Selection mechanism.
	  People, the code I had to write for cut-and-paste is a nightmare!
	
From 0.3.0 to 0.3.1: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 16 May 2000)
	* Updated README for the changes in twattach and for
	  multiple display support.
	* Fixed autoloading consolemap translation from
	  kernel, which got broken in 0.3.0
	* Fixed `disable blink/high background' option,
	  which got broken in 0.3.0
	* Fixed small redraw glitches on X11 display
	  when window gets unobscured.
	* Added option `drag' to X11 display driver.
	  The driver will try to use XCopyArea to speedup
	  redrawing only if you explicitly specify `-hw=X[@...],drag...'
	  Previously this was enabled by default, but I noticed
	  many X servers eat more CPU with XCopyArea than with a redraw.
	  Your mileage may vary.
	* Optimized expose events on X11 display not to cause
	  redraws also on other displays.
	* Optimized attach/detach in multi-display scenario
	  if no resize happens: draw only on the new display HW.
	* Finished smart display resizing. Try attaching/detaching/resizing
	  one of the displays when multiple ones are used...
        * Finished twdisplay (required adding some new libTw functions).
	  Actually a pair of small things are still missing in twdisplay:
	  cut-and-paste compatibility with the real display (X11, etc..)
	  and palette changing support, but it is equally *VERY* usable.
	  
	  	Please take a few minutes to carefully (re)read
	  	section 8. Attach/Detach of the README
	  	as twdisplay adds noticeable power
	  	to twin's attach/detach capabilities!
	  
	
From 0.2.8 to 0.3.0: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 10 May 2000)
	* Added VNC-style multiple simultaneous displays support
	  and updated twattach to manage them. Now you can have
	  twin:0 display on X and on twin:1 which displays on twin:0 ...
	  Also fixed a few deadlocks related to such a setup.
	* (UNFINISHED) Added VNC-style client-implemented displays:
	  `twdisplay' starts a display driver then connects
	  to twin and registers it. This allows any kind of setups,
	  including attaching twin on a console of another machine,
	  or having twin:0 display both on X and on twin:0 itself (!),
	  and also protects twin from deadlocks and crashes
	  of libX11 and other libraries used for the various displays.
	* Due to the two changes above, NEVER assume twin quitted
	  just because you closed all its displays.
	  Even killing a server (X, another twin, ...) where twin
	  was displaying may not kill it;
	  To be sure twin actually exits, either use Menu -> File -> Quit
	  from the default menu or, if you really feel brutal,
	  send it a fatal signal (SIGTERM, SIGSEGV, ...).
	  Sending SIGKILL is not advised, as tty displays will be left
	  messed up and you will get a stale /tmp/.Twin:<x> socket.
	* Modified HW display drivers to allow multi-head.
	* Modified libTw to allow multi-head,
	  and bumped version number to libTw.so.2.
	  Clients will need to be recompiled to use the new library.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Display to list / detach displays.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Refresh.
	* Continued libggi display.
	  Still INCOMPLETE (keyboard doesn't work), but I feel more and more
	  unsatisfied by libggi and lost enthusiasm about it.
	* Fixed memory and file descriptor leaks in Tw_Close()
	* Added option `-hw=tty@-' to twattach:
	  tells twin to attach to its own controlling tty.
	  (`-hw=tty' instead uses the controlling tty of twattach)
	  
From 0.2.7 to 0.2.8: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 02 May 2000)
	* Added options `stdout' and `TERM=<terminal>' to display `-hw=tty'
	  The first is to force twin to use stdout as display method on
	  Linux console even if vcsa is available.	  
	  The second option makes possible for twattach to specify
	  the terminal type.
	  Usage: `-hw=tty[@device],TERM=<term>' or `-hw=tty[@device],stdout'
	* Added option `font=<fontname>' to display `-hw=X'.
	* Added INCOMPLETE support for libggi display, use with `-hw=ggi'
	* Added `-padx <X>' and `-pady <Y>' options to twsetroot.
	* Added option `-e cmd [args ...]' to twterm. Example: twterm -e pine
	* Cleaned up mixing Menu -> File -> Suspend and Menu -> File -> Detach
	* Cleaned up core dumping:
	  core now correctly spots where fatal signals were received.
	* Added consolemap translation support,
	  in a way that is independent from the underlying display
	  (the one in 0.2.7 worked only on Linux console with -hw=tty,stdout)
	  Created `twmapscrn', the twin-equivalent of `mapscrn'.
	  When started from Linux console, twin will already load the current
	  consolemap translation, so twmapscrn is often not necessary.
	  This will hopefully make a certain russian user happy *GRIN*.

From 0.2.6 to 0.2.7: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 17 Apr 2000)
	* Added configurable screen background, and the external program
	  `twsetroot' to customize it.
	* Top window and Focused window are no longer the same thing:
	  now you can focus a non-top window too.
	* Also changed the effect of the BACK button on the window
	  top-right corner: now it acts as Raise+Focus on non-top windows,
	  and as Lower+UnFocus on top window.
	* Left-clicking on a window no longer Raises it, only Focuses it:
	  try dragging or resizing a non-top window ;)
	* Left-clicking on the screen background UnFocuses all windows
	  and pops up the Default Menu.
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Raise/Lower
        * Added WM Smart Window Placement.
	  Coders note: Just don't specify where you want to Map the window,
	  and the WM will (try to) choose a good place.
	* Added X11 selection compatibility: you can now cut-n-paste
	  from X11 to twin and vice-versa.
	* Hopefully fixed non-english (russian, ...) translation table support
	  when running on Linux console (i.e. mapscrn(8); feedback welcome).
	  On other displays, it is just not supported yet :(
	* Fixed a memory leak in twsysmon.
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when moving windows out-of-screen.
	
From 0.2.5 to 0.2.6: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 04 Apr 2000)
	* Fixed random SEGFAULT on Menu -> Window -> Send HotKey
	* Fixed an insidious bug:
	  after twin was detached-and-reattached, the tty of the next
	  opened shell window was becoming the controlling tty of twin;
	  instead a reattached twin should run with no controlling tty at all.
	  This had the nasty side effect of killing twin
	  when closing the <next opened shell window> !
	* Added configure option to disable blink / high intensity background
	  on textmode terminals. This should fix headaches of people
	  too lazy to use SVGATextMode that keep looking at blinking
	  focused window ;)
	* Finished Window List. It pops up by middle-click on the desktop,
	  and it also gets automatically updated when you
	  open/close/reorder windows :)
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Scroll for keyboard-based window scrolling.
	* `twattach -v <args>' now reports any error message generated
	  during the attach attempt (`-v' stands for `verbose').
	  Unluckily, this change makes version 0.2.6 of twin and twattach
	  incompatible with older versions. Always use twin and twattach
	  of the same version and you will be fine.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Option window to change runtime options:
	  shadows displacement, cursor visibility, tty blink/high background,
	  auto-hide menu, custom font (the latter requires running on
	  a Linux console and loading the VGA font file fonts/vgafont.raw)
	  
	  Side effect: When the Menu is auto-hidden, Menu -> Window -> <ZOOM>
	  gives a real fullscreen window.
	
From 0.2.4 to 0.2.5: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 27 Mar 2000)
	* Made display size persistant (if HW allows twin to choose size).
	* Fixed `twattach -hw=tty' to correctly react to window size change,
	  and fixed `Twin, native' display method for the same problem.
	* Cleaned up copyright: libTw is now LGPLed.
	* Added KeyCode support on X11 and Linux console drivers:
	  keyboard event also report a meaningful TW_* code for direct
	  keyboard recognition. This allows keyboard shortcuts for
	  menu/window/screen actions like resizing a window
	  or transversing a menu. Infact next change is...
	* Rebuilt hotkey support for menu/window/screen actions.
	* Started adding Window List and Menu `Common Items'.
	* Modularized HW display drivers. If you compiled some HW support
	  as module, twin will NOT autoprobe for it and you will need to use
	  `twin -hw=<display>' to load and use a modularized HW driver.

From 0.2.3 to 0.2.4: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 20 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT at startup when compiled without
	  "Use custom malloc/free routines (EXPERIMENTAL)".
	* Fixed build problems when compiling without X11 support.

From 0.2.2 to 0.2.3: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 14 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a bunch of SEGFAULTs when displaying a screen without windows.
	* Added a second screen, just to show twin handles it.
	* Added a default menu when no windows are on screen...
	  so I can omit showing the clock at startup without
	  making twin useless :)
	* Added libTw support: twin can now directly connect to another twin,
	  open a window there and display on it.
	* Twin can now runtime attach/detach to any supported display;
	  look README, section "8) Attach/Detach" for details.
	* Added twin_wrapper to have twin append its TWDISPLAY on command line.
	
From 0.2.1 to 0.2.2: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 06 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when switching to X11 display method
	  after a Suspend.
	* Added gzip (compressed) socket support.
	
From 0.2 to 0.2.1: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 22 Feb 2000)
	* Optimized main loop by reordering MsgPort checks;
	  Result: removed two extra loops across the whole main loop
	  for each external event (keyboard,mouse,clients) received.
	* Tweaked socket protocol to decrease bandwidth usage.
